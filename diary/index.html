            <p>Participating in the La Paroza theatre contest was a significant and transformative experience for me, one that tested my resilience and leadership skills in ways I had not anticipated. Joining the contest just one week before the event, I found myself thrust into a challenging position when I was assigned as one of the choreographers and leader of the entire performance. This rapid transition was daunting; however, it was an opportunity I felt compelled to embrace.</p>

            <p>From the outset, I quickly realized that this experience would not only require me to apply my creative skills but also demand a great deal of emotional fortitude. The handler of the contest valued our opinions highly, which meant that my contributions, as well as those of my peers, were crucial in shaping the final performance. Despite the supportive environment, misunderstandings began to surface early in the process. The choreography I envisioned was often misinterpreted, leading to significant confusion among team members.</p>

            <p>Compounding this challenge was the realization that our group faced backstabbing from some individuals who were not fully aligned with our vision. It was disheartening to experience this level of negativity, especially when my goal was to foster a collaborative and creative atmosphere. However, I chose to confront these issues with calmness and composure. Instead of allowing the negativity to derail our efforts, I focused on resolving conflicts constructively. I listened to the criticism directed at us, using it as an opportunity to improve my teaching methods and better guide the team. This process taught me the importance of resilience in leadership.</p>

            <p>As the day of the performance approached, my schedule became increasingly hectic. I found myself so engrossed in the preparations that I regrettably did not have time to document the journey we had undertaken together. Despite this, the performance itself was a remarkable culmination of our hard work and dedication. It may not have been the smoothest experience, but the energy and passion we put into the performance shone through, resulting in a show that left a lasting impression on our audience.</p>

            <p>The recognition we received from our dean was the icing on the cake. It validated all the effort, stress, and emotional turmoil we had endured. While I may not consider this experience my best, I am still grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with the College of Computer Science Department. Together, we created something beautiful and meaningful, proving that challenges can lead to growth and fulfillment.</p>
